Subject: Request for Confirmation of Project Assignment and Clarification on Bench StatusDear [Manager's Name],I hope this email finds you well.I am writing to seek clarification regarding my current assignment status. As of 16th July 2024, I received a communication indicating that I have been released from my previous project and placed in the bench pool. Following this, I have also received instructions to provide daily updates on the assigned courses as per the bench policy.However, during our recent conversation on Teams, you mentioned that I should start working on the P&G HK/TW project. Given that I am officially still on the bench, I am currently in a state of uncertainty regarding my role and responsibilities.To resolve this situation and ensure proper coordination, I kindly request you to send an email to [Bench Manager's Name] clarifying my reassignment to the P&G HK/TW project. This will confirm that I should focus on my new project tasks and ignore the bench-related communications.Your prompt assistance in providing proper allocation in the P&G HK/TW project would be greatly appreciated, as it will help streamline my responsibilities and avoid any potential conflicts.Thank you for your support and understanding.Best regards,Mohammad Nadeem
